* [😢 Struggling with GoDaddy support. Moved a domain&#039;s NS to Cloudflare, then setting DNSSEC, for which GD are required to submit a DS record to the parent zone (managed by the TLD registry, e.g., JPRS for .jp), but they claim the NS has to be controlled by them to do it. It&#039;s required by ICANN you twits! 🌧️

* [💬 If you&#039;re using AI in your work, are you finding it to be too intense sometimes, even exhausting?
